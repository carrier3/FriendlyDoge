# FriendlyDoge

Link to the temporary site - https://friendlydoge.creed3.repl.co/

This project contains an embedded Dogecoin mini game which I have created using Scratch. 
Instructions on how to play the game are stated on the page.
The page also features a glowing title font, an animated background that I designed through Canva, a separate css file,
as well as an external link to my ecommerce shop which lists a mobile-friendly PDF journal that I have designed myself. 
The shop has a plugin that allows it to accept both crypto currency and fiat as payment.
